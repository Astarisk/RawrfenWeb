# RawrfenWeb
A barebones web version of Haven and Hearth.

The goal of this project is to create a web client version of hafen. The real long term goal is to make it playable through a "MUD"
like interface, with chat commands and such. Currently all that is uploaded to this Github is the service that creates a connection
to the hafen server through a websocket.


Not much else to say until the project is further along. I will upload the website half of the project once I get it into a functioning
state.
